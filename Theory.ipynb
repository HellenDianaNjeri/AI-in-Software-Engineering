    "### Q1: How AI-driven code generation tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) reduce development time. What are their limitations?\n",
    "\n",
    "**How they reduce development time:**\n",
    "- **Speed & productivity:** Suggests full lines or functions, reducing typing time.\n",
    "- **Context-awareness:** Offers code suggestions based on comments and prior code.\n",
    "- **Learning aid:** Helps junior developers understand common patterns and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Correctness:** Generated code might work syntactically but be logically flawed.\n",
    "- **Security risks:** Vulnerable code may be suggested without validation.\n",
    "- **Legal/licensing issues:** Trained on public data, potentially including copyrighted code.\n",
    "- **Creativity limits:** Poor at solving unique architectural problems.\n",
    "- **Over-reliance:** Can hinder learning or deep code understanding.\n",

    "| **Data requirements** | Needs annotated datasets                                 | Requires only raw code or logs                           |\n",
    "| **Advantages**        | High precision for known bug types                       | Can detect unknown or novel bugs                         |\n",
    "| **Limitations**       | Limited to seen bugs; expensive to label data            | Prone to false positives; lacks clear interpretability   |\n",
    "| **Use cases**         | Detecting SQL injection, buffer overflows, etc.          | Detecting anomalies in execution patterns or metrics     |\n",

    "### Q3: Why is bias mitigation critical when using AI for user experience personalization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias mitigation is crucial because:\n",
    "- **Avoids discrimination:** Prevents reinforcing stereotypes in personalized content.\n",
    "- **Fairness:** Ensures equal treatment of users regardless of background.\n",
    "- **Compliance:** Meets ethical and legal standards like GDPR or anti-discrimination laws.\n",
    "- **Trust:** Biased systems reduce user trust and engagement with the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of bias include showing different job ads or product recommendations based on gender, which can limit opportunities or skew perceptions.\n",

    "**Q: How does AIOps improve software deployment efficiency? Provide two examples.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Predictive Failure Detection**\n",
    "- AIOps can analyze logs, metrics, and traces to forecast deployment failures.\n",
    "- Example: Predicting a configuration issue or memory spike and alerting before release.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Automated Rollback and Remediation**\n",
    "- If a deployment causes errors or outages, AIOps can automatically trigger rollbacks or container restarts.\n",
    "- This reduces MTTR (Mean Time to Repair) and avoids manual escalation.\n",
